mobile application using JAVA, and MySQL

Bridella mobile application addresses a prevalent issue in the bridal industry by providing a solution to the challenges faced by brides-to-be when searching for and renting bridal gowns. The problem statement emphasizes the limitations of traditional bridal gown shopping, including the high costs, time-consuming processes, and lack of variety in styles and sizes. To overcome these challenges, the Bridella application aims to offer a user-friendly platform with key features such as a diverse selection of bridal gowns, a secure booking and payment system, and a user-driven review and rating system.

The development process began with the implementation of the mobile application using Android Studio and the Java programming language. The team created a project named "navigation drawer" and initiated the definition of user interface (UI) elements in XML files. The Java programming language was then employed in the corresponding .java files to handle events and user inputs, incorporating various elements such as TextView, EditText, Button, RecyclerView, and ImageView.

The iterative process of designing the UI and implementing the corresponding functionality was applied to each activity and fragment within the application. Additionally, the team introduced essential dependencies in the build.gradle file, including 'androidx.coordinatorlayout:coordinatorlayout:1.2.0' and 'com.google.android.material:material:1.9.0,' to enhance the application's design and user interface.

In summary, the Bridella application is poised to revolutionize the bridal gown rental experience by leveraging Android Studio and Java to create a visually appealing and functionally robust mobile application. The focus on a seamless UI, diverse gown selection, secure transactions, and user feedback mechanisms aligns with the goal of providing brides-to-be with a convenient and cost-effective solution for their wedding attire needs.
